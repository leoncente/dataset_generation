Ensure that it avoids conversational phrases like 'thank you' or 'I appreciate' and instead focuses on concise and direct comments. Check if your review addresses key issues, such as security vulnerabilities or code improvements, and offers clear suggestions for resolution. \n\nIf the review was incomplete or too conversational, provide a revised response that adheres to these guidelines. If the review was thorough and professional, confirm this. Remember, you should not refer to the fix commit at any moment."
